  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### What I learned

I learned countless lessons on this project but my favourite was learning how to add the drag and drop functionality and all the JavaScript that went into it.

This YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xh_ZpFkROI) + MDN + ChatGPT is what helped me create it conceptually without looking at the code too much.

### Continued development

I want to eventually fix the responsiveness because I feel like I am setting things way too rigidly.
